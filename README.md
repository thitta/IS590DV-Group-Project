# Note

- It might take few minutes to launch the project on Binder.

- After launch complete, hit the [Volia] button to init the HTML presentation mode. 

- For unknown reason in Binder, some interactive widgets might not initiate correctly. Hitting [screen shot] button is a workaround to solve this problem.

# How to Run this Project on Local

- To avoid dependencies conflict issues, we STRONGLY RECOMMENDED you init a new Python virtual env and install all the dependencies through the requirements.txt file.

- If some images or widgets don't show automatically, try to execute every cell manually (from the first cell to the end).
